Welcome to my world of Game development!
I have uploaded my first game here called Space Shooter. It is set in the year far far away from now, when last of the survivors of the apocalypse,
goes on a journey to find a new home. You as a pilot of the ship have to make sure they reach their destination safely.

HOW TO PLAY
1) Just search the right game executable file according to your OS
2) Download the file 
3) Run it and destroy those nasty Meteors!!!

Things to add:
1) Better way of keeping score
2) Add different levels
3) Animations for different events like meteor destruction
